## What is AsciiDoctor

AsciiDoc is a text document format. It can be used for writing documentation, books, web pages, man pages and many other.

Since it's very configurable, AsciiDoc documents can be converted into many other formats like HTML, PDF, man pages, EPUB, and others.

Because AsciiDoc syntax is quite basic, it has become very popular with a large support in various browser plugins, plugins for programming languages and other tools.
